# LeetCode-Examples

This folder contains solutions to leetcode problems written in python3. 
Leetcode often expects to write the function part that implements the algorithm to solve the problem.
In these notebooks, I have written additional interface functions that coverts the data from the screen to the ones we are supposed to use when solving on leetcode.
For example, in many linked list problems, leetcode website converts the input into a linked list before using the user's function to solve the problem. Then, leetcode displays the output linked list as a list on the screen. These additional interfacing functions are included in the notebooks as well.
